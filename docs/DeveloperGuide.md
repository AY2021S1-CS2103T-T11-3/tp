## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)<br>
Figure 1: Class Diagram of Logic Component.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiComponent.png)
Figure 2: Class Diagram of UI Component.

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of different parts, for example, `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TabPane`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
The `TabPane` holds multiple `Tab` objects, for example, `Inventory` and `Finance`.

All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nustorage/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Updates itself with modified data whenever there are changes made by the user.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)
Figure 3: Class Diagram of Logic Component.

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nustorage/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `NuStorageParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete_finance 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete_finance 1` Command](images/DeleteFinanceSequenceDiagram.png)<br>
Figure 4: Sequence Diagram of Delete Finance Command.
### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)<br>
Figure 5: Class Diagram of Model Component.

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores Inventory and financeAccount data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<InventoryRecord>` and `ObservableList<FinanceRecord>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to the lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (UI, Logic and Storage).

### Storage component

This section shows the structure and logic of the storage component of NUStorage. All storage-related classes are stored in the package `nustorage.storage`. 

Given below is the class diagram of the `storage` component.

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)
Figure 6: Class Diagram of Storage Component.

The storage component comprises three different sections:

1. The `UserPrefStorage` section:
    - loads the user preferences and settings on start up.
    - stores the user preferences and settings upon exiting .

2. The `FinanceAccountStorage` section:
    - loads the previously saved finance records on start up.
    - stores new finance records as they are added / logged into the software.
    
3. The `InventoryStorage` section:
    - loads the previously saved inventory records on start up.
    - stores new inventory records as they are added / logged into the software.


**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nustorage/storage/Storage.java)

* Saving inventory:

    * Given below is the **activity** diagram for saving the inventory. Saving finance account works similarly.
    This diagram shows the decision pathways of the storage component when saving inventory.
    
        ![Activity Diagram for saving inventory](images/SavingInventoryActivityDiagram.png)<br>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `nustorage.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Record Command Feature

This section explains the implementation of the Add Record command feature. As the implementation of adding Inventory / Finance Records are very similar, in this section we will only be going through the implementation of Adding Inventory Records.

The Add Inventory command results in an inventory record added to the list. All but one field in the record must be filled by the user, which are: Item Description and Quantity. There is one optional field, Cost, which when filled, creates a Finance Record that is linked to the Inventory Record reflecting said cost. 

Therefore, we need to use the `ParserUtil#parseItemDescription` as well as `ParserUtil#parseQuantity` methods inside the `parser` package which checks and extracts the item description and quantity (as well as cost if the field is filled). If the compulsory fields are valid, `AddInventoryRecordCommandParser` creates an `AddInventoryRecordCommand` object. The Sequence Diagram below shows how the `AddInventoryRecordCommand` object is created in `AddInventoryRecordCommandParser`. Take a look at the Logic Class Diagram in the [Logic Component](#logic-component) section of the DG, where `AddInventoryRecordCommandParser` is represented as 'XYZCommandParser' in the diagram, if you would like to have a fuller understanding of the entire process starting from user input.

![AddInventoryRecordSequenceDiagram](images/AddInventoryRecordSequenceDiagram.png)<br>
Figure 11. Sequence Diagram for Add Inventory upon parsing.

The `AddInventoryRecordCommand` has been successfully created and its `execute` method would be called by `LogicManager#execute`, which is in turn called by `MainWindow#executeCommand`. Below is another sequence diagram that depicts the interactions between `LogicManager`, `AddInventoryRecordCommand`, `ModelManager` as well as `Storage`, when `AddInventoryRecordCommand#execute` is called.

![inventoryCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram](images/InventoryCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png)<br>
Figure 12. Sequence Diagram for `AddInventoryRecordCommand#execute()`

As you can see, the Inventory Record, as well as a Finance Record (if the cost field was filled), is added into NUStorage's [Model Component](#model-component). In addition, the new lists of Inventory Records and Finance Records are saved into the [Storage Component](#storage-component) of NUStorage. At the end of the operation, a `CommandResult` object is returned in which we will use for UI purposes.

Now, all there is left is to display a message to the user informing him/her about the status of their command input, as well as the created inventory / finance records. The `CommandResult` object returned previously is now used to create a new `CommandBox` object, which is used to display items on NUStorage's UI. All of this happens when `UiManager#fillInnerParts()` is called. Below is a sequence diagram depicting the entire scenario.

<a name="figure13">![inventoryUI](images/InventoryUI.png)<br></a>
Figure 13. Sequence Diagram for `UiManager#start()`

With this, the Add Inventory Record command fully finishes executing and NUStorage's UI displays the status messages for the user to see.

### List Records Command Feature

This section explains the implementation of the List Records command feature. As the implementation of listing Inventory / Finance records are very similar, in this section we will only be going through the implementation of Listing Inventory Records.

The List Inventory command results in all stored inventory records to be listed on NUStorage's GUI. There are no fields to be filled by the user, only the command `list_inventory` is required to carry out and execute the command.

Once `NuStorageParser#parseCommand()` successfully parses a `list_inventory` command, a `ListInventoryCommand` object is created. This scenario is depicted in the sequence diagram below.

![ListInventoryRecordSequenceDiagram](images/ListInventorySequenceDiagram.png)<br>
Figure 14. Sequence Diagram for List Inventory upon parsing.

The `ListInventoryCommand` has been successfully created and its `execute` method would be called by `LogicManager#execute`, which is in turn called by `MainWindow#executeCommand`. Below is another sequence diagram that depicts the interactions between `LogicManager`, `AddInventory` as well as `ModelManager`, when `ListInventoryCommand#execute` is called.

![ListCommandExecuteSequence](images/ListCommandExecuteSequence.png)<br>
Figure 15. Sequence Diagram for `ListInventoryCommand#execute()`

Now, all there is left is to display a message to the user informing him/her about the status of their command input, as well as displaying all listed Inventory Records on NUStorage's GUI. The `CommandResult` object returned previously is now used to create a new `CommandBox` object, which is used to display items on NUStorage's UI. All of this happens when `UiManager#fillInnerParts()` is called. The sequence diagram is the same as the one depicted in [Figure 13]

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Proposed features for future implementation**

1. Customizable Commands<br>
   1. We understand that not everybody that uses NUStorage would be comfortable with the current names of commands. Therefore, we plan to implement a feature that allows users to rename the commands to better suit their liking.
   
1. Graphical Depiction<br>
   1. Currently, NUStorage only displays inventory and finance records as a static listing. We plan to include a new feature that displays the data in a graphical manner.
   
   1. Expanding on this, we could include a number of graphical options, such as pie charts, bar graphs and line graphs.
   
1. Saving inventory as items instead of records<br>
   1. Currently, NUStorage saves inventory as records. For business that constantly deals with the same set of items daily, it might seem tiresome to constantly have to add inventory records of the same item. Thus, we plan to implement a feature that allows users to 'save' a certain inventory item for reuse, allowing them to only have to type the quantity when adding records.
